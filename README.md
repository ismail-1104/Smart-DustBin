# Iot Based Smart Dustbin

> **Abstract** : The increasing waste generation and the adverse effects of improper waste management have become a pressing concern for our planet. The need for sustainable waste management has led to the development of smart technologies that help in efficient waste segregation and management. The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a game-changing technology in this regard. One such application is the development of an IoT-based smart dustbin that segregates dry and wet waste.
The proposed smart dustbin aims to solve the problem of improper waste segregation and disposal. The smart dustbin is equipped with sensors and technology that allow it to differentiate between dry and wet waste. The dustbin can detect the moisture content of the waste and segregate it accordingly. This technology helps in reducing the load on landfills and promotes sustainable waste management practices.
The system operates on a wireless network that connects the dustbin to a central server. The central server collects data from the dustbin and sends it to the cloud for analysis. The system also uses machine learning algorithms to continuously improve waste segregation accuracy.
The IoT-based smart dustbin has the potential to revolutionize waste management systems by making the process more efficient, sustainable, and cost-effective. This technology can be implemented in homes, public spaces, and commercial buildings, contributing to a cleaner and greener environment.
